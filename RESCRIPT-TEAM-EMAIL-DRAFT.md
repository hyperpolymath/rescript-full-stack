## Email Body

Hi ReScript Team,

I'm Jonathan Jewell from The Open University, maintainer of the Hyperpolymath ecosystem (500+ repositories). I wanted to share how we're using ReScript at scale in ways that might interest the community.

### TL;DR

- **A2ML:** Type-safe markup language with ReScript parser + WASM compilation
- **500+ repos:** Planning ReScript adoption across ecosystem
- **Use cases:** Language tooling, FFI bindings, systems programming beyond web apps
- **Showcase document:** https://github.com/hyperpolymath/rescript-full-stack/blob/main/HYPERPOLYMATH-RESCRIPT-OPPORTUNITIES.md

### Key Projects

**1. A2ML (Attested Markup Language)**
- Repository: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/a2ml
- ReScript-powered parser for typed markup with formal verification
- WASM compilation for browser-native validation (45KB output)
- Demonstrates ReScript for language tooling, not just web UIs

**2. Universal ABI/FFI Standard**
- Idris2 ABIs + Zig FFI + ReScript bindings
- 8 FFI repositories providing ReScript access to system libraries
- Shows ReScript for systems-level interop

**3. Ecosystem-Wide Adoption**
- 500+ repositories, many moving to ReScript from TypeScript
- Standards-based approach (RSR - Rhodium Standard Repositories)
- ReScript chosen for: type safety, compiled output, no runtime overhead

### Opportunities for ReScript

**Blog Posts / Case Studies:**
- "Building a Markup Language Parser in ReScript" (A2ML)
- "ReScript to WASM: Performance & Workflow"
- "Beyond Web Apps: ReScript for Language Tooling"

**Documentation:**
- Add A2ML to ReScript showcase page
- Tutorial: Building parsers in ReScript
- Guide: ReScript → WASM compilation

**Community Engagement:**
- Conference talk: "ReScript: Beyond Web Apps"
- Would love to collaborate on official documentation
- Happy to contribute case studies, tutorials, or examples

### Why Share This?

ReScript is often seen as "just for React apps," but we're proving it excels in:
- Compiler/parser implementation
- WASM compilation workflows
- Large-scale ecosystem management
- Systems programming with FFI

I've documented these use cases in detail here:
https://github.com/hyperpolymath/rescript-full-stack/blob/main/HYPERPOLYMATH-RESCRIPT-OPPORTUNITIES.md

### How Can We Collaborate?

- **Showcase:** Feature A2ML or Hyperpolymath on rescript-lang.org
- **Documentation:** Contribute tutorials for non-web ReScript use cases
- **Feedback:** Review our ReScript usage and suggest improvements
- **Community:** Cross-promotion in ReScript forums/Discord

I'm happy to provide more details, examples, or access to any repositories. Let me know if there's interest in highlighting these real-world ReScript applications!

Best regards,

**Subject:** ReScript Showcase: A2ML Language Tooling + 500-Repo Ecosystem

Hi ReScript Team,

I maintain the Hyperpolymath ecosystem (500+ repos) and wanted to share our ReScript usage:

**A2ML** - Type-safe markup language with ReScript parser + WASM compilation
https://github.com/hyperpolymath/a2ml

**Key Point:** We're using ReScript for language tooling and compilers, not just web apps. Would love to collaborate on showcasing these use cases!

Full details: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/rescript-full-stack/blob/main/HYPERPOLYMATH-RESCRIPT-OPPORTUNITIES.md

Happy to discuss case studies, documentation, or conference talks.

Best,
Jonathan Jewell
